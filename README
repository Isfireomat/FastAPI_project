This is a test project for learning FastAPI.
The essence: the program compares a uploaded image pixel by pixel with 
other images in the database.
Images are cached in Redis to reduce the number of database queries.
Authorization is also implemented through JWT tokens.

Start:
    docker-compose up --build

Tested:
    docker-compose run test
    
Make migrations: 
    docker-compose exec app poetry run python -m alembic upgrade head
